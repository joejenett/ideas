					<p>I&#39;ve no shortage of screens around me, each holding worlds of information and ideas with the potential to capture moments of my own creativity . I&#39;ve surely got the tools I need to make a difference in the world but they&#39;re dark at the moment waiting for my next move. One needs to look in a window to see what&#39;s on the other side.</p>
					<h2>my wonderful problem</h2>
					<p>When it&#39;s just me and my guitar, I can improvise some really cool stuff, especially the blues. The joy of creating a song spontaneously makes the words flow out of me in one-off moments of expression like a river disappearing at the horizon. But if I do something in advance intending to capture the music and words, it&#39;s a whole different story. I sit there hesitating and nothing comes out. Maybe I&#39;m just really not that good at planning my creativity. It happens on its own and it seems I&#39;m never quite ready to capture it. One thing precludes the other for me but fortunately, it&#39;s the act of expression that turns me on.</p>
					<p>But if I don&#39;t share my creative works with others, there&#39;s no feedback or interaction and the value is greatly diminished. I need to get better at capturing my ideas if sharing is the goal. Doing what I do in a quiet void is like being behind one of those dark windows – no one else will see what&#39;s on the other side unless I start using some of these tools more.</p>
					<p>Selling cannot be the goal. If it were, there would be nothing of value for others to see. Creating superficial ideas intended for profit is something I&#39;m just not interested in. I&#39;d rather just stay in the void and keep it real.</p>
					<h2>so here I am</h2>
					<p>For now, I&#39;m self-medicating my need to be creative by making and singing my songs in this quiet place. What it does for me is why I do it but activating a few of those dark screens soon is a real good idea.</p>
