 "You'll see...things will be better in Florida." 
</p>
 <p>
 Packing us all into the old Ford and hitting the road was the plan of the day.&nbsp; Running was always the way of dealing with things and this was a run for the gold. 
</p>
 <p>
 "I'm gonna miss him.&nbsp; He took care of us and now we're on our own.&nbsp; But don't worry, I'll find another man who will love us." 
</p>
 <p>
 She couldn't understand the concept of being worth something.&nbsp; Men and women, in her mind anyway, each had their roles to play.&nbsp; The men took care of the women, and in return the women did whatever they had to do.&nbsp; She would start a business in Florida which would feed us all until she found the new Mr. Right.&nbsp; It all meant nothing but a temporary belief in herself.&nbsp; She could start a business but if she had to do it on her own, it would have to be temporary.&nbsp; How could it be otherwise? 
</p>
 <p>
 "Can we stop?&nbsp; I have to go to the bathroom." 
</p>
 <p>
 "Soon, dear, soon." 
</p>
 <p>
 The long road flies by us as rain hits the hood of the old Ford.&nbsp; What could we do but go along with this plan?&nbsp; One day we'll grow up and do our own running.&nbsp; One day we'll grow up and regress just like she has. 
</p>
 <p>
 "Why do people die Mom?" 
</p>
 <p>
 "They just do honey, they just do." 
</p>
 <p>
 We finally stop and for a moment, I think of running away.&nbsp; They won't miss me - I'm not worth anything to them anyway.&nbsp; It's a circular thing.&nbsp; I go to the bathroom and return to the car knowing that I have nowhere else to go.&nbsp; An eleven year old goes where he's taken. 
</p>
 <p>
 "You'll see, kids, it'll all work out in Florida."
